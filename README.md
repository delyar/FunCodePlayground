# Fun Code Playground

Here is a fun python program that needs your help. It is supposed to check if a number is palindrome, fetch the weather like a  meterologist, and scrape webpages like a pro.

## Here is a quick guide:
- Fork the repository and clone on your system.
- Set up your Git using SSH (if you haven't already). If you like, you can make a dummy commit in the readme file by adding today's date.
- Install these dependencies first, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
- Try running the code `python main.py`, it will pass 0 of 3 test cases. 

Let the experimenter know once you have completed the setup. Now, we will begin our task.

## The checkpoints of your developer journey in this repository: here are your subtasks:
(Let the experimenter know when you arrive at and when you complete each subtask. Note: You are not allowed to change the main function.)
- Create and checkout your own git branch `Participant-ID-fix` to get started. Now in your branch, remove code smells from the code. Your goal is to find out what code smells are, where it occured, and how you can fix it? [Don't try to fix the functionalities yet! We will tackle it in the next subtask].

- Next, fix the code (the functions) now such that all the test cases pass. [Do not augment the `main()` method]
- Finally, commit your changes and raise a Pull Request (PR). Your goal is to find out what PRs are and how you can do it?
<!-- - There is merge conflict on one of the branches named `experimenter-help`. Your goal is to find out what merge conflicts are, why it occured here, and how you can fix it? -->

At each checkpoint, the experimenter may prompt you for having a short discussion.

## Essentially you will be helping the experimenters by:
- removing all code smells from the code.
- Fixing the functionalities
  - pallindrome: determine if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.
  - help with weather forecasting! Use the NOAA-SDK python library to retrieve up-to-date weather data for any location, making it an expert weather guru.
  - help with web scraping, where it can crawl through a webpage and save all the visible elements to an HTML file, like a magpie collecting shiny objects.
- Raising a PR to include your contribution
<!-- - Resolving the conflict in 'experimenter-help' so that it is merge ready. -->
