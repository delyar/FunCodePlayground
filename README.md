# Fun Code Playground

Here is a fun python program that needs your help. It is supposed to check if a number is palindrome, fetch the weather like a  meterologist, and scrape webpages like a pro.

## Here is a quick guide:

- Fork the repository and clone on your system.
- Install these dependencies first, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
- Try running the code, it will pass 0 of 3 test cases. 

## What it needs your help with:
- pallindrome: determine if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.
- help with weather forecasting! Use the NOAA-SDK python library to retrieve up-to-date weather data for any location, making it an expert weather guru.
- help with web scraping, where it can crawl through a webpage and save all the visible elements to an HTML file, like a magpie collecting shiny objects.

## The checkpoints of your developer journey in this repository: here are your subtasks:
- Create your own git branch to get started.
- Remove code smells from the code. Your goal is to find out what code smells are, where it occured, and how you can fix it?
- Fix the code (the functions) now such that all the test cases pass.
- Commit your changes and raise a Pull Request (PR). Your goal is to find out what PRs are and how you can do it?
- There is merge conflict on one of the branches named "<>". Your goal is to find out what merge conflicts are, why it occured here, and how you can fix it?

At each checkpoint, the experimenter may prompt you for having a short discussion.
